COSI 103a CPA 1, analyzing a data set. 

This dataset shows anime and their reccomendation scores based on the website MyAnimeList.net aggregated until the year 2020.

You can find this dataset by going to https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020 and clicking the download button on the "anime.csv" file.

The questions I have are:

    1. What is the top rated anime?
    2. What is the most watched & most dropped anime?
    3. What are the most popular genres?
